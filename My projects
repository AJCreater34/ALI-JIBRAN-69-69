Welcome to my coding projects portfolio! Over the past few years, I have embarked on a diverse range of programming projects,showing my skill and exploring my varios domians within the field of coding. These projects show what I am capable of. Here is an overview of some of the key areas and projects I have worked on:

Firstly, the calculator app. This applicaton is a simple yet unique app that allows users to perform any type of calculation. Users can change modes from normal to scintific or vice-versa. It also allows the user to change the theme of the calculatorusing the RGB wheel, and the clours wiould be saved. This calculator is GUI software in which users can not only use thier keyboard, but also the Key on the GUI. I will upload the code in some time on GitHub, stay tuned! This application is made in both C and python.

Secondly, the youtube app. This application is exactly like the youtube app it self, but with some less fetaures and not as efficant as the real one. Users can upload vedio, preview the vidio, change or upload vedio or a thumbnail. When a vedio is uploaded, it is sent straight to the public where everyone is able to view it. Also has to be uploaded on GitHub(C and Python).

Thirdly, The minecraft game. This minecraft game has two versions, both ave the basic minecraft theme, but one is 2-D and one 3-D. The 3-D one includes quite some complex coding, and the game it self looks very realistic. With the same fetaures and physics, this game is perfect for minecraft fans. The 2-D game icludes a charcter that moves in a day and night cycle. Nothing else ispossible in it. Unlike the other version, the 2-D mincraft does not allow users to place or break blocks, change difficulty or gamemode, write commands, or include mobs. This game has not yet been released either, but I will upload for sure!

Stay tuned for the applications, and i will be seeing you in the next one!
